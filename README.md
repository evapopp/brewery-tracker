# The Brew for You

## Objective
Planning a trip? Have pals in town? Tired of your "usual" beer spot? The Brew for You app allows you to search for breweries based on city name and returns a list of breweries for that location. Once you select a brewery from the list, you are given the breweries address, phone number and website to make sure it's the brewery for you! This serverless app is deployed using Netlify and fetches data from the api: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/
